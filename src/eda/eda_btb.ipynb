    "   - final_mPNPorg\n",
    "   - final_infiltrat_B_BNSP\n",
    "   - final_infiltrat_A_A1_A2\n",
    "   - These features are categorical, describing various histological findings in the biopsy samples.\n",
    "   - All have 2,519 non-null entries, indicating complete data for these important diagnostic markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **clust** (int64):\n",
    "   - Represents a cluster assignment, from a previous classification by the INSERM team.\n",
    "   - All 2,519 entries are non-null, suggesting each biopsy has been categorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **protocol_cause** (object):\n",
    "   - Indicates whether the biopsy was done as part of a protocol or for a specific cause.\n",
    "   - This distinction is crucial for understanding the context of each biopsy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **NEFG2** (object):\n",
    "   - Likely a patient identifier.\n",
    "   - Complete data (2,519 non-null entries) allows for patient-level analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **delai_prelevement** (int64):\n",
    "   - Possibly represents a delay or time interval related to the biopsy procedure.\n",
    "   - Integer type suggests it might be measured in days or another discrete unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **time_point** (object):\n",
    "   - Categorical variable indicating the timing of the biopsy in relation to the transplant.\n",
    "   - Crucial for longitudinal analysis of patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Date Fields** (datetime64[ns]):\n",
    "   - date_prelevement: Date of the biopsy.\n",
    "   - LT_date: Likely the date of lung transplantation.\n",

    "    - final_C4d (int64): Likely indicates presence/absence of C4d, a marker for antibody-mediated rejection.\n",
    "    - final_C4d_distrib (float64): Possibly describes the distribution of C4d.\n",
    "    - final_C4d_int (float64): Might represent the intensity of C4d staining.\n",
    "    - Note: final_C4d has 2,519 non-null entries, while final_C4d_distrib and final_C4d_int have only 810 non-null entries each, indicating missing data for these more detailed C4d assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete Core Data**: Most fields have complete data (2,519 non-null entries), which is excellent for comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing C4d Data**: The detailed C4d fields (distribution and intensity) have significant missing data, with only 810 out of 2,519 entries populated. This may limit certain analyses related to C4d characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Information**: The presence of both biopsy date and transplant date allows for detailed temporal analysis, including time since transplant for each biopsy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Categorical and Numerical Data**: The dataset combines categorical histological findings with numerical and datetime data, allowing for diverse analytical approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Patient-Level Analysis**: The NEFG2 field likely allows for grouping biopsies by patient, enabling longitudinal studies of individual patient trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Protocol vs. Cause Biopsies**: The distinction between protocol and cause-driven biopsies provides context for interpreting findings and may correlate with patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Longitudinal tracking of histological changes post-transplant.\n",
    "2. Correlation between histological features and time since transplant.\n",
    "3. Comparison of findings between protocol and cause-driven biopsies.\n",
    "4. Cluster analysis to identify patterns in histological features.\n",
    "5. Investigation of C4d presence and its relationship with other histological findings.\n",
    "6. Patient-specific trajectories of biopsy results over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The meaning of some coded variables (e.g., clust, N_sans_P) may require additional context for full interpretation.\n",
    "2. The significant missing data in C4d distribution and intensity fields may limit comprehensive analysis of C4d-related outcomes.\n",
    "3. Without additional outcome data (e.g., graft survival, patient survival), the prognostic value of these findings may be limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rich dataset provides a solid foundation for in-depth analysis of transbronchial biopsy findings in lung transplant patients, with potential for significant insights into post-transplant lung health and rejection patterns."

    "# Interpretation of Transbronchial Biopsy Data Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This summary provides detailed statistics for a dataset of 2,519 transbronchial biopsies, likely from lung transplant patients. The data includes various histological features, timing information, and patient identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sample Size and Patient Distribution\n",
    "- Total biopsies: 2,519\n",
    "- Unique patients (NEFG2): 498\n",
    "- Most biopsied patient: 13 biopsies (NEFG2: 274444)\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates multiple biopsies per patient, allowing for longitudinal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Biopsy Types\n",
    "- Protocol biopsies: 1,961 (77.8%)\n",
    "- For cause biopsies: 558 (22.2%)\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority are protocol biopsies, suggesting routine follow-ups are more common than symptom-driven biopsies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Histological Features\n",
    "All histological features are binary (0 or 1), with varying distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- final_capillarite_agg_0: 1,422 (56.5%)\n",
    "- final_hyperplasie_pn_0: 2,335 (92.7%)\n",
    "- final_pn_alv_0: 2,415 (95.9%)\n",
    "- final_fibrin_alv_0: 2,411 (95.7%)\n",
    "- final_mPNPorg_0: 2,185 (86.7%)\n",
    "- final_infiltrat_B_BNSP_0: 2,301 (91.3%)\n",
    "- final_infiltrat_A_A1_A2_0: 2,158 (85.7%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most features show a high prevalence of '0' values, indicating that positive findings are relatively rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Clustering (clust)\n",
    "- Range: 1 to 6\n",
    "- Mean: 2.41\n",
    "- Median: 2\n",
    "- Standard deviation: 1.66\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests an uneven distribution across clusters, with lower-numbered clusters being more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Time-Related Information\n",
    "- delai_prelevement (likely days since transplant):\n",
    "  - Mean: 289.86 days\n",
    "  - Median: 149 days\n",
    "  - Range: 20 to 3,311 days\n",
    "- Biopsy dates range: 2011-10-26 to 2019-12-05\n",
    "- Transplant dates range: 2010-02-16 to 2019-11-01\n",
    "\n",
    "This wide range allows for both short-term and long-term follow-up analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. C4d-Related Data\n",
    "- final_C4d (n=2,519):\n",
    "  - Mean: 0.326 (32.6% positive)\n",
    "- final_C4d_distrib and final_C4d_int (n=810):\n",
    "  - Significant missing data (67.8% missing)\n",
    "  - For available data:\n",
    "    - C4d distribution mean: 0.641\n",
    "    - C4d intensity mean: 0.507\n",
    "\n",
    "The high percentage of missing C4d distribution and intensity data limits comprehensive analysis of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Longitudinal Studies**: The dataset supports patient-specific trajectory analysis over time.\n",
    "2. **Rare Events**: Most histological features have low prevalence, which may require special statistical approaches for rare event analysis.\n",
    "3. **Clustering Analysis**: The uneven distribution of cluster assignments warrants investigation into cluster characteristics and potential clinical significance.\n",
    "4. **Time-Based Analysis**: The wide range of follow-up times allows for both short-term and long-term outcome studies.\n",
    "5. **C4d Analysis**: While presence/absence of C4d is well-documented, the limited data on distribution and intensity may restrict detailed C4d-related analyses.\n",
    "6. **Protocol vs. For Cause Comparison**: The dataset allows for comparison of findings between routine and symptom-driven biopsies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The binary nature of histological features may not capture subtle gradations in pathology.\n",
    "2. Missing data in C4d distribution and intensity limits comprehensive analysis of antibody-mediated rejection patterns.\n",
    "3. Without additional outcome data, the prognostic value of these findings may be limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rich dataset provides a solid foundation for in-depth analysis of transbronchial biopsy findings in lung transplant patients, with potential for significant insights into post-transplant lung health and rejection patterns."

    "\n",
    "1. Cluster 4 shows significant differences with all other clusters:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Cluster 4 stands out significantly from all other clusters in terms of the timing of biopsies post-transplant. Biopsies in Cluster 4 tend to occur:\n",

    "   - Much earlier than those in Clusters 5 and 6 (by about 205-309 days)\n",

    "2. The timing of biopsies in Clusters 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 do not differ significantly from each other, suggesting similar temporal patterns for these clusters.\n",

    "3. There's a suggestive difference between Clusters 5 and 6 (about 103 days), but it doesn't reach statistical significance at the 0.05 level.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The significant differences associated with Cluster 4 suggest that it may represent a distinct phase in the post-transplant journey, possibly associated with specific clinical characteristics or outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The lack of significant differences among most clusters indicates that many pathological patterns (represented by clusters) can occur across various time points post-transplant, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings highlight the complex relationship between time since transplant and the pathological patterns observed in biopsies. They suggest that while some pathological states (like those in Cluster 4) may be time-dependent, many others can occur across various time points, underscoring the importance of regular, long-term monitoring of lung transplant patients."
